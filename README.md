Project Overview

In this project, I worked on developing a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning techniques. The provided code included the environment setup and basic framework for the agent’s training process. I contributed by implementing the Q-learning algorithm, fine-tuning the reward system, and adjusting the training parameters to improve the agent’s performance in navigating the maze. Additionally, I modified parts of the neural network architecture to optimize the agent’s decision-making capabilities.

Connecting Learning to the Field of Computer Science

Throughout this course, I gained insights into how reinforcement learning and neural networks address complex problems in computer science. Computer scientists play a vital role in creating algorithms and systems that can learn, adapt, and solve real-world challenges. This project demonstrated the practical application of these concepts, emphasizing the importance of problem-solving, innovation, and adaptability in the field.

Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist

As a computer scientist, my approach to problem-solving involves breaking down complex issues into manageable components, designing algorithms, and iteratively refining solutions. For this project, I started by understanding the environment and the agent’s goals, then implemented and tested the Q-learning algorithm, adjusting hyperparameters based on performance metrics. This systematic process allowed me to enhance the agent’s efficiency and effectiveness.

Ethical Responsibilities

Ethics in computer science is crucial. My responsibilities include ensuring that the systems I develop are fair, transparent, and prioritize user safety. For this project, I considered the implications of reinforcement learning in real-world applications, such as autonomous navigation. I aimed to create an agent that learns effectively without unintended biases or harmful consequences, aligning with ethical standards to benefit both the end user and the organization.
